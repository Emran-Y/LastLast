# Test Project

This project integrates a PHP server with a JavaScript-based frontend for dynamic data fetching and filtering.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Run the PHP server using `php -S localhost:8000 -t php/public`.
3. Access the UI at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view filtered data based on user input.
4. start the client using `npm start`

## Note
The attempt to use "node-php-server" for running the PHP server was unsuccessful, as the package is deprecated. More information is available on the [official repository](https://github.com/jaceju/node-php-server).
